# Tasks: Widgetbook Component Catalog & Documentation Site

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-widgetbook-docs-site/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested. Visual verification via Widgetbook previews serves as the test mechanism.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story for incremental delivery.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup

**Purpose**: Initialize Widgetbook Flutter web app with dependencies

- [ ] T001 Create widgetbook/pubspec.yaml with dependencies: flutter, widgetbook, designsystemet_flutter (path: ../), and configure for web in widgetbook/pubspec.yaml
- [ ] T002 Create widgetbook/web/index.html with Flutter web bootstrap and base href for GitHub Pages in widgetbook/web/index.html
- [ ] T003 [P] Create directory structure: widgetbook/lib/components/, widgetbook/lib/helpers/ per plan.md
- [ ] T004 [P] Create widgetbook/lib/main.dart entry point that launches the Widgetbook app

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Theme & Scope Addons)

**Purpose**: Custom addons that wrap all component previews with DsTheme, DsColorScope, DsSizeScope

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: All component use cases depend on these addons

- [ ] T005 Implement theme addon: wraps previews in DsTheme with light/dark toggle using DsThemeDigdir.light()/dark() in widgetbook/lib/helpers/theme_addon.dart
- [ ] T006 [P] Implement color scope addon: dropdown with all 9 DsColor values (accent, neutral, brand1-3, success, danger, warning, info) wrapping preview in DsColorScope in widgetbook/lib/helpers/color_scope_addon.dart
- [ ] T007 [P] Implement size scope addon: toggle with sm/md/lg wrapping preview in DsSizeScope in widgetbook/lib/helpers/size_scope_addon.dart
- [ ] T008 Wire addons into widgetbook/lib/main.dart Widgetbook app configuration with all three addons active
- [ ] T009 Run `flutter run -d chrome` in widgetbook/ and verify the app launches with empty catalog and addon controls visible

**Checkpoint**: Widgetbook shell running with theme/color/size addons.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Theme & Mode Switching (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Light/dark theme toggle and color scope switching update all previews

**Independent Test**: Select DsCard, switch to dark theme, verify colors update

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Automated Deployment (Priority: P4)

- [ ] T060 [US4] Configure GitHub repository Pages settings to serve from gh-pages branch (document manual step in README)
- [ ] T061 [US4] Test deployment by pushing to main and verifying site is live at https://stigvaage.github.io/designsystemet-flutter/

**Checkpoint**: Site auto-deploys on push to main.

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final touches and validation

- [ ] T062 Verify search/filter works to find components by name in the Widgetbook sidebar
- [ ] T063 Verify deep-linking: copy URL of a specific component, open in new tab, verify it navigates directly to that component
- [ ] T064 Add library name, version, and GitHub repo link to the Widgetbook app header/footer in widgetbook/lib/main.dart
- [ ] T065 Update root README.md to add link to the live documentation site
- [ ] T066 Run `flutter build web --base-href /designsystemet-flutter/` in widgetbook/ and verify build succeeds with no errors

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies — can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup — BLOCKS all user stories
- **US1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational — all 40 component use cases
- **US2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Phase 2 addons — verifies theme/color/size switching
- **US3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 — adds descriptions to existing use cases
- **US4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Phase 1 — GitHub Actions workflow is independent of components
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 at minimum

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Phase 1 tasks T003, T004 can run in parallel
- All Phase 2 addon tasks T006, T007 can run in parallel
- **ALL 40 component use case tasks T010–T049 can run in parallel** (different files, no dependencies)
- US3 description tasks T055–T058 can run in parallel
- US4 (Phase 6) can run in parallel with US1/US2/US3

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Addons (theme/color/size)
3. Complete Phase 3: All 40 component use cases
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run locally, verify catalog works
5. Deploy manually or via Phase 6

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Addons → Widgetbook shell running
2. Add US1 → Full interactive catalog → Deploy
3. Add US2 → Verify theme switching → Redeploy
4. Add US3 → Norwegian descriptions → Redeploy
5. Add US4 → Auto-deployment pipeline

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- All 40 component use case tasks (T010–T049) are maximally parallelizable
- Each use case file is self-contained — imports the component and creates knobs
- Widgetbook handles sidebar navigation, search, and deep-linking automatically
