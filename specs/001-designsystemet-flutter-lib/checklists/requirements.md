# Specification Quality Checklist: Designsystemet Flutter Component Library

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] CHK006 Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] CHK015 Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- CHK001 note: The spec deliberately includes Dart type signatures and widget names because this is a library specification — the "users" are developers, and the component API surface IS the feature. This is domain-appropriate, not an implementation leak.
- CHK003 note: Stakeholders for this library are Flutter developers and design system teams, so technical component names are the appropriate level of abstraction.
- CHK008 note: SC-002 references a specific URL (storybook.designsystemet.no) as a visual reference, which is appropriate for a design system fidelity requirement. SC-006 references a linting standard, which is a quality gate rather than an implementation detail.
- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
